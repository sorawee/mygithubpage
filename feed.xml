This is my 7<sup>th</sup> attempt to write a blog... Hopefully it’s not gonna fail like last time!</p><p>In the previous attempts, I hosted my blog with blog sites such as Wordpress or Blogspot. For this time, as you can see, I host it in my own website (powered by Github Pages), so it will (hopefully) be different!</p><p>And, you see, the blog content is not that important. The most crucial thing is to get the technology right. What I’m using right now is called <a href="http://pollenpub.com/">Pollen</a> markup, which is pretty much a domain-specific language based on Racket’s <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/reader.html">@-syntax</a>. Pollen is very cool because it sets up a server which recompiles files automatically whenever it detects changes. The markup itself is very cool in a sense that you just write whatever you want to write with arbitrary made-up semantics tags, which is very pleasant to write using the said syntax. Then, you can go back and define and format what those tags are supposed to be. The programming part is equally pleasant because it has <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/xml/">X-Expression</a> which is a cool version of XML. Pollen supports outputting multiple targets: <span class="latex">L<span class="latex-sup">a</span>T<span class="latex-sub">e</span>X</span>, <code>html</code>, plain text, or whatever you want to output. Basically, you program the document, so you have an unlimited power to do whatever you want.</p><p></p></p><p><a href="http://sorawee.me/blog/2016-12-22-new-website.html">Click here to read <i>My New Website</i></a></p>]]></summary></entry><entry><author><name>Sorawee Porncharoenwase</name></author><updated>2016-12-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated><title type="text">My New Laptop &amp; Settings</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sorawee.me/blog/2016-12-22-new-laptop.html"/><id>http://sorawee.me/blog/2016-12-22-new-laptop.html</id><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><p>I switched from Ubuntu to Macbook Pro since 2013 and was very happy with it. About 5 months ago, the screen was broken, so I planned to buy a new one.
