Here’s an excerpt:</p><blockquote><ol><li>The password must be exactly 8 characters long.</li><li>It must contain at least one letter, one number, and one of the following special characters.</li><li>The only special characters allowed are: @ # $</li><li>A special chaacter must not be located in the first or last position.</li><li>Two of the same characters sitting next to each other are considered to be a “set.” No “sets” are allowed. Example: rr, tt</li><li>Avoid using names, such as your name, user ID, or the name of your company or employer.</li><li>Other words that cannot be used are Texas, child, and the months of the year.</li><li><p>A new password cannot be too similar to the previous password.</p><ul><li>Example: previous password - abc#1234; unacceptable new password - acb$1243</li><li>Characters in the first, second, and third positions cannot be identical. (abc*****)</li><li>Characters in the second, third, and fourth positions cannot be identical. (*bc#****)</li><li>Characters in the sixth, seventh, and eighth positions cannot be identical. (*****234)</li></ul></li><li>A password can be changed voluntarily (no Help Desk assistance needed) once in a 15-day period. If needed, the Help Desk can reset the password at any time.</li><li>The previous 8 passwords cannot be reused.</li></ol><p>One way to create a password is creative spelling and substitution. Examples:</p><ol><li>phuny#2s</li><li>fish#1ng</li><li>t0pph@ts</li><li>run$4you</li><li>ba#3ries</li></ol></blockquote><p>I’m terrified.</p><p></p><p><a href="http://sorawee.me/blog/2017-02-25-counting-possible-passwords.html">Click here to read <i>Counting Possible Passwords</i></a></p>]]></summary></entry><entry><author><name>Sorawee Porncharoenwase</name></author><updated>2017-02-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><title type="text">On Induction</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sorawee.me/blog/2017-02-01-on-induction.html"/><id>http://sorawee.me/blog/2017-02-01-on-induction.html</id><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post, I will write about three kinds of inductions: weak induction, strong induction, and structural induction. I in fact dislike these terms because, as I will show below, they are equivalent. Personally, when I think of induction, I will default to the structural induction. Last semester I took a logic class, and they introduce these terms, and also “formula induction”, “proof induction”, “term induction”, “sequence induction”, etc. I was like: *sigh* THEY ARE THE SAME WHY DO YOU NEED DIFFERENT NAMES.</p><p>Anyway, for the sake of this article, we will do use these terms for clarity and show the following.</p><p></p><p><a href="http://sorawee.me/blog/2017-02-01-on-induction.html">Click here to read <i>On Induction</i></a></p>]]></summary></entry><entry><author><name>Sorawee Porncharoenwase</name></author><updated>2017-01-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><title type="text">Bulk Scraping</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sorawee.me/blog/2017-01-06-bulk-scraping.html"/><id>http://sorawee.me/blog/2017-01-06-bulk-scraping.html</id><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of my friends who is a non-CS concentrator would like to scrape emails of all faculties listed in <a href="http://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/eecs/faculty-staff/index.php">this website</a>. Unfortunately, the emails are not on the page itself, but are on subpages. It would take forever to scrape the data by hand, so I helped. To do this, I need to send multiple requests to scrape each subpage. Naively, we would send a request, wait for a response, then repeat until we go over all list of faculties. This however would take a lot of time. We can do better by sending requests asynchronously. This is feasible because there is no dependency in the data.</p><p></p><p><a href="http://sorawee.me/blog/2017-01-06-bulk-scraping.html">Click here to read <i>Bulk Scraping</i></a></p>]]></summary></entry><entry><author><name>Sorawee Porncharoenwase</name></author><updated>2017-01-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated><title type="text">Colorful Parentheses!</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sorawee.me/blog/2017-01-03-colorful-parentheses.html"/><id>http://sorawee.me/blog/2017-01-03-colorful-parentheses.html</id><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I tried to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation">continuations</a> yesterday.

This is my 7<sup>th</sup> attempt to write a blog... Hopefully it’s not gonna fail like last time!</p><p>In the previous attempts, I hosted my blog with blog sites such as Wordpress or Blogspot. For this time, as you can see, I host it in my own website (powered by Github Pages), so it will (hopefully) be different!</p><p>And, you see, the blog content is not that important. The most crucial thing is to get the technology right. What I’m using right now is called <a href="http://pollenpub.com/">Pollen</a> markup, which is pretty much a domain-specific language based on Racket’s <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/reader.html">@-syntax</a>. Pollen sets up a server which recompiles files automatically whenever it detects file changes. The markup itself is very cool in a sense that you just write whatever you want to write with arbitrary made-up semantics tags, which is very pleasant to write using the said syntax. Then, you can go back and define and format what those tags are supposed to be. The programming part is equally pleasant because it has <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/xml/">X-Expression</a> which is a cool version of XML. Pollen supports outputting multiple targets: <span class="latex">L<span class="latex-sup">a</span>T<span class="latex-sub">e</span>X</span>, <code>html</code>, plain text, or whatever you want to output. Basically, you program the document, so you have an unlimited power to do whatever you want.</p><p></p><p><a href="http://sorawee.me/blog/2016-12-22-new-website.html">Click here to read <i>My New Website</i></a></p>]]></summary></entry><entry><author><name>Sorawee Porncharoenwase</name></author><updated>2016-12-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated><title type="text">My New Laptop &amp; Settings</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sorawee.me/blog/2016-12-22-new-laptop.html"/><id>http://sorawee.me/blog/2016-12-22-new-laptop.html</id><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I switched from Ubuntu to Macbook Pro since 2013 and was very happy with it.
